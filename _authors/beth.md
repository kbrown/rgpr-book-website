Beth Reingold is Associate Professor of Political Science and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Emory University, and Chair of the WGSS Department. She received her PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley. Her research foregrounds gender and race/ethnicity within the politics of representation and identity in the U.S. Her current work focuses on American state legislatures to examine: race-gender inequalities and biases in legislative leadership; anti-feminism/conservatism and women’s representation; and Black-Latinx dynamics of immigration politics and policymaking.
