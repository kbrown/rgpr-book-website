<p>Chapter 1 introduces the book’s motivating questions and puzzles about race, gender, and political representation, particularly as they pertain to women of color in the U.S. It summarizes and critiques existing research that examines women’s representation with little regard to race/ethnicity or minority representation with little regard to gender and calls for a more intersectional approach. The authors detail what intersectionality as a critical research paradigm entails and how they adapt and apply it to the study of representation in state legislatures. A preview of the remaining chapters follows, outlining the central questions, analyses, and findings of each. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the study’s normative implications for democratic politics and its epistemological implications for the study of race, gender, and political representation.</p>
