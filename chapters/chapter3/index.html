<p>Chapter 3 examines the relationship between descriptive and substantive representation – who among officeholders advocates for whom – by re-evaluating prevailing notions of group interests, with a critical intersectional lens. Do single-axis conceptions of women’s issues, Black interests, and Latinx interests obscure the representational efforts of women of color, especially when they include only narrowly or explicitly defined group-specific concerns? Extensive analysis of policy leadership activity in fifteen state houses in 1997 and 2005 shows that women of color are always on the forefront of legislating on behalf of group interests, no matter how they are defined. Their leadership is particularly strong and distinctive on issues of overlapping concern to all three groups, namely health and education. Ignoring issues of health and education, which are not always framed explicitly in group-specific terms, therefore, will underestimate the leadership of women of color and obscure the complexities of race, gender, and representation.</p>
